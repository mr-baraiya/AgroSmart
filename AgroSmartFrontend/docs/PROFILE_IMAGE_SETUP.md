# Profile Image Setup Instructions

## Steps to add Vishal Baraiya's profile image:

### Method 1: Manual Copy
1. Copy your profile image from:
   `C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\dempo.jpg`

2. Rename it to: `vishal-baraiya-profile.jpg`

3. Place it in the public folder:
   `d:\VS_CODES\.NET_Project\AgroSmart\AgroSmartFrontend\public\vishal-baraiya-profile.jpg`

### Method 2: Command Line Copy
Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
copy "C:\Users\ASUS\Downloads\dempo.jpg" "d:\VS_CODES\.NET_Project\AgroSmart\AgroSmartFrontend\public\vishal-baraiya-profile.jpg"
```

## Alternative: Using the existing image
If you prefer to keep using the placeholder icon, you can update the team member data to use "/default-profile.png" instead.

## What has been updated:
- ✅ Updated name to: "Vishal Baraiya"
- ✅ Updated image path to: "vishal-baraiya-profile.jpg" 
- ✅ LinkedIn profile link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/baraiya-vishalbhai/
- ✅ Enhanced image handling with better fallback
- ✅ Added proper error handling for missing images
- ✅ Improved image styling with rounded corners

The About page now displays:
- Your name: "Vishal Baraiya" 
- Your role: "Founder & CEO"
- Your LinkedIn profile link with a clickable button
- Professional profile image (once you copy the file as instructed above)

## Troubleshooting:
- If image doesn't show: Check if the file exists in the public folder
- If image is distorted: The code uses `object-cover` to maintain aspect ratio
- If fallback icon shows: The image file wasn't found or failed to load
