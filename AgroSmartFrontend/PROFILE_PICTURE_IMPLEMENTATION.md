# Profile Picture Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

### API Integration
I've successfully integrated the two new profile picture API endpoints:

1. **POST /api/User/{id}/UploadProfilePicture**
   - Handles multipart/form-data file uploads
   - Returns image URL on success
   - Integrated with proper error handling

2. **DELETE /api/User/{id}/DeleteProfilePicture**
   - Removes profile picture from user
   - Returns updated user object
   - Proper error handling and user context updates

### New Components Created

#### 1. ProfilePicture Component (`src/Components/common/ProfilePicture.jsx`)
- **Reusable**: Works for both user and admin profiles
- **Multiple Sizes**: sm, md, lg, xl variants
- **File Validation**: 
  - Accepted formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF
  - Maximum size: 5MB
  - Client-side validation before upload
- **Toast Integration**: All operations show toast notifications
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during upload/delete operations
- **Fallback Avatar**: Gradient background with user icon when no image

#### 2. Enhanced Profile Component (`src/Components/auth/Profile.jsx`)
- **Updated**: Integrated ProfilePicture component
- **Toast Notifications**: Replaced all SweetAlert calls

- **Security Features**: Password change functionality
- **Toast Integration**: Modern notification system

#### 4. User Profile Page (`src/pages/user/UserProfile.jsx`)

- **Consistent Experience**: Same functionality as main profile

### Service Updates

#### UserService (`src/services/userService.js`)
Added two new methods:
```javascript
// Upload profile picture
uploadProfilePicture: (id, formData) => api.post(`/User/${id}/UploadProfilePicture`, formData, {
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data' }
})

// Delete profile picture  
deleteProfilePicture: (id) => api.delete(`/User/${id}/DeleteProfilePicture`)
```

7. Click delete button â†’ Should see confirmation and revert to default avatar

### 2. Admin Profile Testing
1. Navigate to admin profile page (if admin user)
2. Same upload/delete testing as user profile

5. Test password change functionality

### 3. API Response Testing
1. Check browser network tab during upload
2. Verify FormData is sent correctly
3. Confirm proper Authorization headers
4. Check image URL format in response
5. Verify delete operations return updated user object

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Process
1. User selects file via hidden input
